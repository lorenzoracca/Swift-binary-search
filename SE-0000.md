# Improve Collection Partitioning Methods

* Proposal: [SE-0000]()

## Introduction

This proposal adds new collection APIs for partitioning, testing whether a collection is partitioned, and finding the partition point. Partitioning is a foundational API for sorting and for searching through sorted collection.

- Swift-evolution thread: [Feedback from standard library team](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016729.html)

## Motivation

Based on feedback during the review of proposal [SE-0074, Implementation of Binary Search functions](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0074-binary-search.md), this is a revised proposal focused only on the partitioning methods of the original.

The standard library's current `partition` methods, which partition a mutable collection based on the value of the first element of a collection, are used by the standard library's sorting algorithm but don't offer more general partitioning functionality. In addition, the standard library offers no ability to find the partition point for a particular predicate or test whether a collection is already partitioned.

## Proposed solution

The standard library should add three new collection methods that improve the standard library's partitioning capabilities, each taking a unary (single-argument) predicate. These new methods are `partition(where:)`, which replaces the two existing `partition` methods; `partitionPoint(where:)`, which returns the position in the collection of the first element that satisfies the predicate; and `isPartitioned(where:)`, which returns `true` if and only if a collection is partitioned according to the predicate.

- `partition(where:)` is a mutating method that accepts a unary predicate. The elements of the collection are rearranged according to the predicate, so that there is a pivot index `p` where no element before `p` satisfies the predicate and every element at and after `p` *does* satisfy the predicate. 

    ```swift
    var n = [30, 40, 20, 30, 30, 60, 10]
    let p = n.partition(where: { $0 > 30 })
    // n == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30, 60, 40]
    // p == 5
    ```

    After partitioning, the predicate returns `false` for every element in `n.prefix(upTo: p)` and `true` for every element in `n.suffix(from: p)`.

- `partitionPoint(where:)` accepts a unary predicate and returns the index of the first value in the collection that satisfies the predicate. The elements of the collection must already be partitioned by the predicate.

    ```swift
    var a = [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 60]
    a.partitionPoint(where: { $0 >= 20 })       // 1
    ```

    If no element in the collection satisfies the predicate, the result is the collection's `endIndex`:
    
    ```swift
    a.partitionPoint(where: { $0 >= 100 })      // 7
    ```

    If you have a binary (two-argument) predicate, like `<`, you can construct unary predicates for `partitionPoint(where:)` that find the lower and upper bound for a given value (for example, `30`):

    ```swift
    let lower = a.partitionPoint(where: { !($0 < 30) })   // 2
    let upper = a.partitionPoint(where: { 30 < $0 })      // 5
    ```
    
    The lower and upper bound are sorted insertion points for that value. The half-open range formed by an element's lower and upper bound encompass all the elements of that value in a collection:
    
    ```swift
    let all30s = a[lower..<upper]       // [30, 30, 30]
    ```

- `isPartitioned(where:)` accepts a unary predicate and returns `true` if and only if there is some index `p` where the predicate returns `false` for every element in `c.prefix(upTo: p)` and `true` for every element in `c.suffix(from: p)`. This is an important method to include to help developers tests their assumptions and preconditions when using the methods described above.

    ```swift
    a.isPartitioned(where: { $0 >= 20 })        // true
    
    a.isPartitioned(where: { $0 % 20 == 0 })    // false
    a.partition(where: { $0 % 20 == 0 })
    // a == [10, 30, 30, 30, 20, 40, 60]
    a.isPartitioned(where: { $0 % 20 == 0 })    // true
    ```
    
## Detailed design

`partition(where:)` should be added as a `MutableCollection` requirement with default implementations for mutable and bidirectional mutable collections. Any mutable collection can be partitioned, but the bidirectional algorithm generally performs far fewer copies. The other two methods can be provided in an extension of the `Collection` protocol.

The proposed APIs are collected here:

```swift
protocol MutableCollection {
    // existing requirements
    
    /// Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the
    /// elements that match the predicate are ordered after all the
    /// elements that do not match the predicate.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The index of the first element in the reordered
    ///   collection that matches the predicate.
    /// - Complexity: O(n)
    @discardableResult
    mutating func partition(
        where predicate: @noescape (Iterator.Element) throws-> Bool
        ) rethrows -> Index
}
    
extension MutableCollection {
    /// See above
    @discardableResult
    mutating func partition(
        where predicate: @noescape (Iterator.Element) throws-> Bool
        ) rethrows -> Index
}

extension MutableCollection where Self: BidirectionalCollection {
    /// See above
    @discardableResult
    mutating func partition(
        where predicate: @noescape (Iterator.Element) throws-> Bool
        ) rethrows -> Index
}

extension Collection {
    /// Returns the index of the first element in the collection
    /// that matches the predicate.
    ///
    /// If no element matches the predicate, the collection's `endIndex`
    /// is returned. The collection must already be partitioned according 
    /// to the predicate, as if `x.partition(where: predicate)` had 
    /// already been called.
    /// 
    /// - Complexity: O(log n)
    func partitionPoint(
        where predicate: @noescape (Iterator.Element) throws -> Bool
        ) rethrows -> Index

    /// Returns `true` iff the collection is partitioned according to
    /// the given predicate.
    ///
    /// - Complexity: O(n)
    func isPartitioned(
        where predicate: @noescape (Iterator.Element) throws -> Bool
        ) rethrows -> Bool
}
```

## Example usage

As an example of how the `partitionPoint(where:)` method enables heterogenous binary search, this `SortedDictionary` type uses an array of `(Word, Definition)` tuples as its storage, sorted by `Word`.

```swift
struct SortedDictionary<Word: Comparable, Definition>:
    Collection, DictionaryLiteralConvertible
{
    var _storage: [(word: Word, definition: Definition)]
    
    // Collection
    var startIndex: Int { return _storage.startIndex }
    var endIndex: Int { return _storage.endIndex }
    subscript(index: Int) -> (word: Word, definition: Definition) {
        return _storage[index]
    }

    // DictionaryLiteralConvertible
    init(dictionaryLiteral elements: (Word, Definition)...) {
        self._storage = elements
            .sorted { $0.0 < $1.0 }
            .map { (word: $0, definition: $1) }
    }

    // key/value access
    subscript(word: Word) -> Definition? {
        get {
            let i = _storage.partitionPoint(where: { $0.word >= word })
            if i != endIndex && _storage[i].word == word {
                return _storage[i].definition
            }
            return nil
        }
        set {
            // find insertion point
            let i = _storage.partitionPoint(where: { $0.word >= word })
            
            if i != endIndex && _storage[i].word == word {
                // update or delete
                if let newValue = newValue {
                    _storage[i].definition = newValue
                } else {
                    _storage.remove(at: i)
                }
            } else if let newValue = newValue {
                // insert
                _storage.insert((word, newValue), at: i)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Impact on existing code

As two of the three methods discussed above are new additions to the standard library, the impact of the change primarily the removal of the existing `partition` methods.

The current sorting algorithms would need to be modified to use the new `partition(where:)` method. Other uses of the existing `partition` methods could be flagged or in theory could be replaced programmatically. The replacement code, on a mutable collection `c`:

```swift
// old
c.partition()

// new
if let first = c.first {
    c.partition(where: { $0 < first })
}
```

A thorough, though not exhaustive, search of GitHub for the existing `partition` method found no real evidence of its use. The discovered uses of a `partition` method were mainly tests from the Swift project and third-party implementations similar to the one proposed.

## Alternatives considered

The primary alternative considered was a suite of binary search methods, as put forward in [proposal SE-0074][se-74].
